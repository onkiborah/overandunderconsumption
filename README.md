# NSSO22-23


This code processes National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) Household Consumer Expenditure (HCE) 2022-23 data to calculate the average daily consumption and the nutritional deficiency or surplus across various food groups for households based on geographic settlement (section), expenditure percentile, state, and diet type. It first loads and merges several datasets, including information on household characteristics, food consumption, and nutrient requirements, while also cleaning and transforming the data to calculate daily food consumption per household. The code then calculates a weighted consumption measure, factoring in household size, food type (veg/non-veg), and food group-specific nutritional requirements. It handles missing food groups and computes the deficit or surplus for each household's consumption, applying weights based on household characteristics. Finally, the processed data is summarized and saved, providing insights into consumption patterns and nutritional deficiencies or surpluses at different geographic and economic levels.
